More than 90 percent of meats, cheeses and produce are sourced from regional artisans. Familiar dishes are given the fine-dining treatment and cater to specific wine pairings.\n\nTake, for example, Moore‚Äôs show-stopping pork chop. A milk-fed piglet tenderloin from Whippoorwill Farms is served in a pool of dark, bourbon-apple veal demi-glace over an autumnal medley of heirloom red cabbage, roasted sweet potatoes, shallots and winter squash. It‚Äôs topped with a lovely stack of pan-seared heritage apples, chopped bacon and a garnish of edible flowers. The plate arrives with a glass of 2017 Rise.‚Äù\n\nWe are proud of the expertise and creativity of our culinary team, led by Executive Chef Tim and our Chef de Cuisine, Kristen Hall. We‚Äôre excited as always to share our table with you.\n\nReserve your table via the link in our bio.\n\nüì∑: @adamewing",
