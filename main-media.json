Much like his screenwriting past, Ben’s winemaking style is one of storytelling, using wine to showcase a moment of time and a place.\n\nHailing from California, Maya has found a new love of wine in central Virginia, by way of studying bubble dynamics of sparkling wine at UC Davis. Maya’s passion for environmentally low-impact viticulture influences all aspects of our responsible growing practices.\n\nTogether, this collaborative duo crafts the incredible wines you know and love.
