It brings more power than you’ll typically find in our interpretation of Cabernet Franc and the 2019 vintage brought deep ripeness. We stayed true to our approach of embracing silky tannin, and the result is a wine that brings purity to the dense black fruit of the vintage with plenty of plum and black cherry. ⁠A smallish crop combined with a very long and warm ripening period makes this one of the most powerful Cabernet Francs we have bottled.⁠ \n⁠📷 @foodphotographer \n⁠\n#nationalchocolateday #earlymountainwinery #winemaking ⁠\n#earlymountainvineyards #vawine #visitvirginia #virginia #madison #winemaking #vineyardlife  #winecountry #vawinecountry #newrelease⁠",
