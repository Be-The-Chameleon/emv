Executive Chef Tim Moore has created a 5-course dinner paired with new releases and award-winning favorites, including our 2017 RISE and inaugural estate Sparkling release. Create merry memories of 2020 with this intimate and extraordinary dinner experience. \n\nThis season we‚Äôre doing things a little bit differently: rather than a communal wine dinner, all tables will be seated as separate parties. With each decadent course, our team will share the vision \"behind the scenes\" of our wines and the bounty we are so honored to elevate.\n\nYou don‚Äôt want to miss this incredible dining experience on 12/11 and 12/18 at our vineyard.",

Older vines produce fewer grapes, but they are more concentrated and can yield a bolder, more layered wine. \n\nOur oldest vines are in the Quaker Run vineyard, on the South and South Eastern sides of Doubletop mountain. There, the rocky soils and near constant air flow contribute to growing quite special grapes. You‚Äôll find them in our wines such as Eluvium, Vow, and an upcoming new release. #ComingSoon #NewRelease\n\nPhoto: Kate M. Greer",

Much like his screenwriting past, Ben‚Äôs winemaking style is one of storytelling, using wine to showcase a moment of time and a place.\n\nHailing from California, Maya has found a new love of wine in central Virginia, by way of studying bubble dynamics of sparkling wine at UC Davis. Maya‚Äôs passion for environmentally low-impact viticulture influences all aspects of our responsible growing practices.\n\nTogether, this collaborative duo crafts the incredible wines you know and love. Come September (or even sooner for our wine Club Members), they have a special surprise in store for you üòè. #NewRelease #ComingSoon",
