The 2019 is here!¬†\n\nA little background for those who might not know this grape or who haven‚Äôt tried this wine yet (you‚Äôre in for a treat):\n\nüçá Petit Manseng thrives in Virginia and is perfectly suited to our clay soils and humid climate\n\nüçá This is a wine of texture, structure, and intensity, perfect for these winter months.\n\nüçá The 2019 vintage has a juicy acidity with tropical notes balanced by the creaminess produced by long aging. It is truly a flavor explosion.\n\nWhether you‚Äôve been tasting evolving Petit Manseng vintages over the years or this is your first time trying this wine, we know you will love it. Order yours today.\n\nüì∑: @foodphotographer\n\n#petitmanseng #oenophile #sommelier #VAwine #newrelease #viticulture #vinification #2019vintage #winterwine #visitva",

More than 90 percent of meats, cheeses and produce are sourced from regional artisans. Familiar dishes are given the fine-dining treatment and cater to specific wine pairings.\n\nTake, for example, Moore‚Äôs show-stopping pork chop. A milk-fed piglet tenderloin from Whippoorwill Farms is served in a pool of dark, bourbon-apple veal demi-glace over an autumnal medley of heirloom red cabbage, roasted sweet potatoes, shallots and winter squash. It‚Äôs topped with a lovely stack of pan-seared heritage apples, chopped bacon and a garnish of edible flowers. The plate arrives with a glass of 2017 Rise.‚Äù\n\nWe are proud of the expertise and creativity of our culinary team, led by Executive Chef Tim and our Chef de Cuisine, Kristen Hall.
