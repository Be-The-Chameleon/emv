Barrel fermented and aged, with primarily older French oak - and a bit of new  northern European oak, coopered in Austria. It was bottled in June having finished malolactic fermentation; a technique we are able to employ for texture and mouthfeel, as we modify our farming approach to favor acidity and freshness. The result is a wine with the roundness and flavors of aging in barrel, on the lees, but also one that retains freshness and the energy of the vintage.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nGrab a bottle with the link in our bio or where ever you buy wine. Early Mountain is now available in NJ and MD!‚Å†",
