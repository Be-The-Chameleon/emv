If you‚Äôre new around here, we are SO pleased to introduce you.\n\nBen is a native Virginian who began his winemaking career in Sonoma County (not before dabbling in theater arts). Much like his screenwriting past, Ben‚Äôs winemaking style is one of storytelling, using wine to showcase a moment of time and a place.\n\nHailing from California, Maya has found a new love of wine in central Virginia, by way of studying bubble dynamics of sparkling wine at UC Davis. Maya‚Äôs passion for environmentally low-impact viticulture influences all aspects of our responsible growing practices.\n\nTogether, this collaborative duo crafts the incredible wines you know and love. Come September (or even sooner for our wine Club Members), they have a special surprise in store for you üòè. #NewRelease #ComingSoon",

The days were perfectly warm while the nights were cool, allowing for our grapes to ripen while preserving their bursts of acidity. When the grapes were ready, our team carefully handpicked each bunch. It was a magical season. #2017Release #ComingSoon\n\nPhoto: @katemgreer",

We'll taste three of the most planted varieties and explore their range from sparkling to white, ros√© and red wines. \n\nThe pack will include: \nRosemont Extra Brut Sparkling (Chardonel)\nEarly Mountain Young Wine White 2019 (Vidal Blanc)\nRosemont Ros√© 2019 (Chambourcin) \nEarly Mountain Young Wine Red 2019 (Chambourcin)\n\nGrab the bundle from our online shop (link in Bio) to taste along or pop your favorite beverage and listen in. \n\nWe will be combining with Rosemont's \"Winemaker Wednesday\" and the tasting can be viewed on either of our Facebook Pages.",
