We'll taste three of the most planted varieties and explore their range from sparkling to white, ros√© and red wines. \n\nThe pack will include: \nRosemont Extra Brut Sparkling (Chardonel)\nEarly Mountain Young Wine White 2019 (Vidal Blanc)\nRosemont Ros√© 2019 (Chambourcin) \nEarly Mountain Young Wine Red 2019 (Chambourcin)\n\nGrab the bundle from our online shop (link in Bio) to taste along or pop your favorite beverage and listen in. \n\nWe will be combining with Rosemont's \"Winemaker Wednesday\" and the tasting can be viewed on either of our Facebook Pages.",

It is wonderful to see so many of you join our virtual tastings, purchase wine through EarlyMountain.com, and support the many fine wine stores that carry EMV wines. We are proud of the way that those who have visited us in the past and those who have discovered us through our virtual events, and through recommendations from friends and wine merchants, have bought EMV wines to drink while they ‚ÄúStay At Home‚Äù. ‚ù§Ô∏è\nWhile we are eager to reopen the tasting room at Early Mountain, we continue to put a priority on the safety, health and well-being of guests, employees and community. Virginia is allowing some establishments to open on a limited Phase I basis; however, we have determined that a further period of evaluation prior to opening our doors to the public is warranted.  We are currently planning on opening for an exclusive wine club member pick-up weekend on June 12th-14th.  We will be posting further updates as to any planned opening of the Tasting Room in the coming days. üçá\nWe believe that patience and care need to be prioritized and will be monitoring this changing situation very carefully to ensure that Early Mountain continues to be the special destination that you know and love. In the meantime, our attention will remain on our vineyards and production facilities where our focus on quality is unwavering and making sure our wines are available to you through our online shop and curbside pickup.  We will also continue to craft thoughtful virtual tastings for our community to enjoy and are working on additional offerings to highlight craft Virginia products as well as sharing some special additional discounts as our way of saying thanks for your support.\n\nI hope everyone is staying safe and we look forward to raising a glass with you soon! \nCheers,\nDave Kostelnik, General Manager",
