More than 90 percent of meats, cheeses and produce are sourced from regional artisans. Familiar dishes are given the fine-dining treatment and cater to specific wine pairings.\n\nTake, for example, Moore’s show-stopping pork chop. A milk-fed piglet tenderloin from Whippoorwill Farms is served in a pool of dark, bourbon-apple veal demi-glace over an autumnal medley of heirloom red cabbage, roasted sweet potatoes, shallots and winter squash. It’s topped with a lovely stack of pan-seared heritage apples, chopped bacon and a garnish of edible flowers. The plate arrives with a glass of 2017 Rise.”\n\nWe are proud of the expertise and creativity of our culinary team, led by Executive Chef Tim and our Chef de Cuisine, Kristen Hall.
