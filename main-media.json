As always, Petit Manseng desires the spotlight, wants the lead (it‚Äôs an extrovert, a little type A), and Sauvignon blanc is happy to be the right hand, though it certainly vamps when PM is not looking. With Petit Manseng in the lead, we feel the density of aroma and texture that are inherent to this grape. The aromatics flow from pear to peach to mango and are repeated as flavors in the palate.‚Å†‚Å†\n‚Å†‚Å†\nShop with link in bio.‚Å†‚Å† ‚ú®\n‚Å†‚Å†\n‚Å†‚Å†",

The acidity matches the texture and brings freshness to the fruit, and the wine lingers with a pleasant citrus pith character. ‚Å†\n‚Å†\n2020 Young Red: Chambourcin is a grape that if you try to make it taste like vinifera, will end up similar to jogging with a cat on a leash. You can do it, but it‚Äôs going to be weird, some folks may disapprove, and it will get its revenge while you sleep (the cat will). Chambourcin‚Äôs spirit animal is not a cat, but rather some theoretical ‚Äúalways puppy‚Äù with a joy and playfulness all its own. ‚Å†\n‚Å†\n2020 Young White: It would be silly to over-describe a wine with a questionable owl on the label, but we should point out that this wine has texture and volume while retaining acidic structure, a result of full malo and long contact with active yeast. The laters and depth of this Vidal are a subtle reflection of the natural technique in the cellar.

For the cover crops and growth between the vines, we gently crimp to encourage the buildup of organic material in the soils.
