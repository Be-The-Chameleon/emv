Older vines produce fewer grapes, but they are more concentrated and can yield a bolder, more layered wine. \n\nOur oldest vines are in the Quaker Run vineyard, on the South and South Eastern sides of Doubletop mountain. There, the rocky soils and near constant air flow contribute to growing quite special grapes. You‚Äôll find them in our wines such as Eluvium, Vow, and an upcoming new release. #ComingSoon #NewRelease\n\nPhoto: Kate M. Greer",

If you‚Äôre new around here, we are SO pleased to introduce you.\n\nBen is a native Virginian who began his winemaking career in Sonoma County (not before dabbling in theater arts). Much like his screenwriting past, Ben‚Äôs winemaking style is one of storytelling, using wine to showcase a moment of time and a place.\n\nHailing from California, Maya has found a new love of wine in central Virginia, by way of studying bubble dynamics of sparkling wine at UC Davis. Maya‚Äôs passion for environmentally low-impact viticulture influences all aspects of our responsible growing practices.\n\nTogether, this collaborative duo crafts the incredible wines you know and love. Come September (or even sooner for our wine Club Members), they have a special surprise in store for you üòè. #NewRelease #ComingSoon",
