The aromas are snappy and alive, with red and black fruits and subtle dried herbs. This medium bodied wine has soft tannins, bringing more to the table than would be expected of its price tag. ‚Å†‚Å†\n‚Å†‚Å†\nFoothills continues to be a Bordeaux-ish blend with lots of the classic grapes plus a few surprises. It is now five years running that we splash (okay, it‚Äôs a big splash this year) in Petit Manseng to play with the aromatics and texture of the wine.‚Å†‚Å†\n‚Å†‚Å†\nShop with the link in our bio, or wherever you buy Early Mountain wines.
