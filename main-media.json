These chillable wines are sure to keep you cool and refreshed all summer long. ⁠\n⁠\n2020 Soif: The two Cabernets are driving the character of this wine, lively and aromatic with plenty of the classic herbal notes tangled up in the bright and fruity carbonic character. ⁠\n⁠\n2020 Rosé: The pale, salmon color primes us for the strawberries, white peaches, red grapefruit, and herbal aromas of this wine. The acidity matches the texture and brings freshness to the fruit, and the wine lingers with a pleasant citrus pith character. ⁠\n⁠\n2020 Young Red: Chambourcin is a grape that if you try to make it taste like vinifera, will end up similar to jogging with a cat on a leash. You can do it, but it’s going to be weird, some folks may disapprove, and it will get its revenge while you sleep (the cat will). Chambourcin’s spirit animal is not a cat, but rather some theoretical “always puppy” with a joy and playfulness all its own. ⁠\n⁠\n2020 Young White: It would be silly to over-describe a wine with a questionable owl on the label, but we should point out that this wine has texture and volume while retaining acidic structure, a result of full malo and long contact with active yeast. The laters and depth of this Vidal are a subtle reflection of the natural technique in the cellar. But let’s not take ourselves too seriously here … the owl just won’t have it.⁠\n⁠\nSummer Sippers, your palate will thank you. Link in bio to shop! ✨⁠\n⁠",

The shoots have quickly reached the top of the trellising wires and we’ll be hedging to prevent shading and focus ripening energy towards grapes, not leaves. For the cover crops and growth between the vines, we gently crimp to encourage the buildup of organic material in the soils. Now it’s countdown to veraison, when the grapes will change from bright green to either red or golden as they gather sugars and head towards harvest. ⁠⁠\n⁠⁠\n⁠",
