More than any other wine, dry Petit Manseng represents our philosophy of winegrowing at Early Mountain: keep progressing, next year will be different. It's also probably the wine most likely to elicit the comment, ‚ÄúDang, this wine changes every year.‚Äù It sure does, we love that about it, and it keeps us coming back for more.‚Äù The 2020 Petit Manseng was fermented warm in a combination of oak puncheon and foudre, concrete, and large Acacia creating a beautiful creaminess enrobing the acidity.‚Å†\n‚Å†\n@foodphotographer ‚Å†\n#earlymountainvineyard  #wine #vineyard #drinkwine #virginia #monticellowinetrail #vawine #drinklocal #virginiawinecountry #petitmanseng ‚Å†",
